This project uses several CSV files from the Cinema Audience Forecasting challenge. Each file describes a different aspect of theaters, bookings, dates, and audience visits, and they are combined to build the final modeling dataset. 

1) cinePOS_theaters.csv  
- Contains theater metadata from the cinePOS system. 
- Key columns:  
  - cine_theater_id: Unique identifier for each cinePOS theater. 
  - theater_type: Type/category of the theater (e.g., Drama, Other). 
  - theater_area: Area/region label for the theater (Area_XXX). 
  - latitude, longitude: Geographic coordinates of the theater. 
- Used to add location and type information to theaters that appear in cinePOS booking data. 

2) booknow_theaters.csv  
- Contains theater metadata from the booknow platform. 
- Key columns:  
  - book_theater_id: Unique identifier for each booknow theater. 
  - theater_type: Type/category of the theater. 
  - theater_area: Area/region label. 
  - latitude, longitude: Geographic coordinates. 
- Used as the main theater reference for the target visits table (`booknow_visits`), and to enrich each theater with static properties. 

3) movie_theater_id_relation.csv  
- Mapping table between booknow and cinePOS theater IDs. 
- Key columns:  
  - book_theater_id: Theater ID in booknow system. 
  - cine_theater_id: Corresponding theater ID in cinePOS system. 
- Used to merge cinePOS booking information into the booknow theater space so that both booking sources can be aggregated per theater. 

4) cinePOS_booking.csv  
- Detailed booking logs from the cinePOS system. 
- Key columns:  
  - cine_theater_id: Theater identifier (links via mapping table). 
  - show_datetime: Date and time of the show. 
  - booking_datetime: When the booking was made. 
  - tickets_sold: Number of tickets sold in that booking record. 
- Used to compute aggregate features such as `cine_tickets` (total tickets sold) and `cine_count` (number of booking records) per theater and date. 

5) booknow_booking.csv  
- Detailed booking logs from the booknow platform. 
- Key columns:  
  - book_theater_id: Theater identifier in booknow system. 
  - show_datetime: Date and time of the show. 
  - booking_datetime: When the booking was made. 
  - tickets_booked: Number of tickets booked in that record. 
- Used to compute aggregate features such as `booknow_tickets` and `booknow_count` per `(book_theater_id, show_date)`. 

6) booknow_visits.csv  
- Core training table containing the historical audience counts. 
- Key columns:  
  - book_theater_id: Theater identifier. 
  - show_date: Date of the show (no time component). 
  - audience_count: Number of people who actually visited the theater on that date. 
- This file defines the prediction target (`audience_count`) that all models try to forecast. 

7) date_info.csv  
- Calendar information for each date in the relevant period. 
- Key columns:  
  - show_date: Date. 
  - day_of_week: Day name (e.g., Monday, Tuesday). 
- Used to create date‑related features (like day_of_week and further derived features such as year, month, day, day_of_year, week_of_year, quarter). 

8) sample_submission.csv  
- Template file specifying the required submission format for Kaggle. 
- Key columns:  
  - ID: Composite identifier of `book_theater_id` and `show_date` for the test set. 
  - audience_count: Placeholder column for predicted values. 
- The final model predictions are written into this format to create `submission.csv` for leaderboard evaluation. 

These datasets are merged and transformed in the notebook to build a single, feature‑rich table at the `(book_theater_id, show_date)` level, which is then used for model training, validation, and final prediction.
